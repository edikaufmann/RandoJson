RandoJson
- Using the Shell sample to learn .net Maui.
- The RandoJson shows 2 (test) hikes I made in the Provence, France.
- The idea is - contrary to RandoGIT .cs - to use .json files for Data.  


# Shell

.NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) Shell reduces the complexity of app development by providing the fundamental features that most apps require, including:

- A single place to describe the visual hierarchy of an app.
- A common navigation user experience.
- A URI-based navigation scheme that permits navigation to any page in the app.
- An integrated search handler.

This sample demonstrates a .NET MAUI Shell app.
